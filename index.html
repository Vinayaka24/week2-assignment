       	     	<p class="p">Our specialities in chicken are 'chicken pepper dry' , 'chilly chicken' , 'chicken manchurian' , 'tandoori chicken' among these you'll find tandoori chicken as the most ordered one. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. Super rich in protein, having paneer for breakfast makes you feel full for longer. It gets digested slowly and increases the amount of feeling full hormones like GLP-1, PYY and CCK.</p>

       	     	<p class="p">Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt),[15] to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2â€“3 hours to improve its texture and appearance. From this point, the preparation of paneer diverges based on its use and regional tradition.In North Indian cuisines, the curds are wrapped in cloth, placed under a heavy weight such as a stone slab for two to three hours, and then cut into cubes for use in curries. Pressing for a shorter time (approximately 20 minutes) results in a softer, fluffier cheese..</p>

       	     	<p class="p">Edible mushrooms are the fleshy and edible fruit bodies of several species of macrofungi (fungi which bear fruiting structures that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye). They can appear either below ground (hypogeous) or above ground (epigeous) where they may be picked by hand.[1] Edibility may be defined by criteria that include absence of poisonous effects on humans and desirable taste and aroma.[2] Edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional and culinary value. Mushrooms, especially dried shiitake, are sources of umami flavor.[3]:11, 52, 110[4] Especially tasty and desired mushrooms are referred as "choice edible".</p>
